# Advent of Code 2021

My attempt in IDL (using the GDL implementation)

## Preprocessed Data

Note: due to limitation of how IDL works (and probably also my lack of knowledge in it) some input has been "pre-processed" in order to be readable by IDL.

Maybe over the days I figure out how to fix those, in which case I will go back and do them with the given input.

**day 2**

(almost) impossible to read mixed data
replaced `forward` with `0`, `down` with `1` and `up` with `-1`
in any other language I would have been able to do so and then map those words to those values anyway

**day 4**

split in two files: one for cards and one for pulls
removed whitespace between cards

**day 5**
removed arrow
replaced `,` with ` `
`0,0 -> 1,1` becomes `0,0,1,1`
